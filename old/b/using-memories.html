		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Remembering hazardous events has important value to communities. Memory on previous disasters not only informs peopleâ€™s knowledge of their environment and vulnerability, it also influences their interpretation of risk and their response to future disaster. Memories on disaster may be expressed in public life in different forms, ranging from memorial plaques to myths. Over time, these manifestations of memory of disaster provide communities with the knowledge, practices and techniques to survive in a particular environment, and enable them to make sense of a disaster in recovery phase. Taking account of cultural memory of disaster could therefore enable disaster risk managers to better meet local needs.
		</p>
		<h1>Memories and disaster</h1>
		<p>
			Cultural memory of disaster plays an important role in determining the way people respond to disaster risk, engage in disaster management practices and accept disaster relief in an emergency situation. It is therefore vital that response agencies become aware of, and accept the different logics and rationalities that people rely on in the face of risk.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Cultural memory</strong> refers to long-term memory which exceeds generations. It may be expressed through many different forms. It is manifested in practices and structures as diverse as storytelling, small talk, myths, official discourses, monuments, rituals, landmarks, and arts.

		<h1>How do you use memories to build resilience?</h1>
		<p>
			Memories of disaster can function as an asset for communities in hazard-prone areas but also for disaster risk managers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many disasters are infrequent and memories, lessons and heightened awareness of risk often fades when time passes. It is therefore important to build a system that preserves disaster awareness and enables the transfer of lessons to the next generation. Already available manifestations of cultural memory can be used as a resource for disaster risk managers to improve disaster risk awareness among populations in hazard prone areas. There are several ways to identify and make use of memories of previous disaster.

		<h1>Memories in Volos (Greece)</h1>
		<p>
			The city of Volos experienced several disastrous events. An exploration of cultural memory of these events revealed that memories of the 1950-54 earthquakes seem to fade. A serious game has been developed that aims to raise awareness on earthquake risk and preparedness amongst youth.

		<h1>Memories in Dordrecht (the Netherlands)</h1>
		<p>
			The city of Dordrecht has been hit by severe flooding in 1421 and 1953. Memories on both disasters can be found in museums, monuments, paintings, and stories. However, risk awareness appears to be low. Together with Dordrecht municipality, opportunities have been identified to transfer knowledge from eye witnesses of the 1953 flood to other inhabitants of the city.
