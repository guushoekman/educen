			<h1>Volos case study</h1>
			<h2 id="2.1">Introducing the Volos CS</h2>
			<p>
				Volos is a coastal port city in Thessaly region situated midway on the Greek mainland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volos). The urban area counts for 150,009 inhabitants (as for 2015) and covers 496.6 km2.
			</p>
			<p>
				Volos is the only outlet to the sea of Thessaly (the country's largest agricultural region) and has been a significant industrial center. After the mid- 80s deindustrialization started which has affected the city severely. The current economic crisis has deteriorated the situation. Presently, the area experiences very high unemployment rates.
			</p>
			<p>
				The city of Volos has experienced several critical disastrous events. This section focuses on cultural memory of two of those events: the influx of refugees between 1922 and 1926 and the series of disasters triggered by earthquakes and floods from 1954-1957.
			</p>
			<p>
				Between 1922 and 1926, a huge number of Greek refugees from Turkey fled to Greece. The exchange of populations following the unsuccessful Campaign of Greece in Asia Minor in 1922 resulted in 1.500.000 Greek refugees moving towards Greece. The easy access to the port and work perspectives in the commercial and industrial sectors of Volos brought 13,773 refugees to Volos, corresponding to more than 40 percent of the population of the city at the time. Many of the refugees ultimately formed the settlement of Nea Ionia (named after the ancient Greek city Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor). Although there was a need for workers especially in the industry, the integration of this new coming Greek population was not smooth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another significant crisis in the history of Volos occurred in the period 1954-1957 when severe earthquakes ruined much of the city (Map of earthquake epicenters to be placed here). The greater area of Volos was known for its seismic activity but until the 1950s there were no disasters noted. This situation changed drastically during a series of earthquakes from 1954 until 1957.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 30th of April, an earthquake of magnitude 7 on the Richter scale in Sofades (50 km from Volos) brought down 231 buildings in Volos and seriously damaged 665, leaving another 930 buildings slightly damaged.  Amongst others the City Hall was ruined. On the 21st of February 1955 another earthquake shook the city, now with a magnitude of 4.6 R, causing the destruction of 36 houses and causing serious damage to about 400 others. Two months later on the April 19, an earthquake of M=6.2R took place followed by severe aftershocks. The earthquake caused the collapse of many buildings s already damaged by the previous shocks. Out of 10,047 buildings, only 1,237 remained sound. Public buildings were destroyed and the city hospital stopped functioning. About 20,000 people became homeless and had to be sheltered. Noticeable earthquakes occurred also on the 2nd of November 1956 and on the 8th of March 1957. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To worsen the situation, six months after the first earthquakes, on the 13th of October 1955, severe rainfall caused the city’s torrents to rise and flooded large areas mostly of the peripheral city neighbourhoods. This incident resulted in 36 dead people and 24 injured, while 1.500 people were deemed officially affected by the flood while the newspapers wrote of about 4.500. Floods are still an issue for the city with severe flood events occurring in 2006 and 2009.
			</p>
			<h2 id="2.2">Rationale of Volos CS: issues to be tackled</h2>
			<p>
				Volos has suffered major crises and disasters in its past. These have been experienced by only few of the present population, this making cultural memory a key issue of Volos case study. Cultural memory of disasters becomes especially important in the era of the current economic and social crisis in Greece which alters the risk perception and the hierarchy of risks. Perception of present socioeconomic risks (such as unemployment, poverty, loss of access to the health and welfare system, homelessness, crime, foreign refugees influx to name only a few) seems to prevail in the risk landscape while disaster risk falls in the hierarchy of risks as perceived by the society. Therefore using existing memory of past disasters in order to advance DRR and disaster management becomes crucial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An analysis of former catastrophes in Volos and in Greece brings up a number of issues and lessons learned that call for an enhanced use of cultural dimensions, among them cultural memory, in and for disaster management. Some of these are: 
			</p>
			<p>
				i) Disaster protection in Greece has a strong technical and engineering drive; cultural aspects are noticeably less known and considered. Rising awareness on cultural aspects of and in disaster management and especially those relating with cultural memory, takes more than simply disseminating information to practitioners and scientists involved in the different phases of disaster management. There is a need to bring together players from different disciplines (such as engineering, geosciences, urban planning) and roles in civil protection and disaster management (such as civil protection practitioners at different administrative levels, local decision makers, school teachers and professors) and to enhance their dialogue on culture and disaster and on how cultural memory can become an asset to DRR and disaster management.
			</p>
			<p>
				ii) Immigrants and foreigner tourists are identified as difficult groups to deal with in crisis and disaster management. The severe immigrant crisis in the ’20s in Volos left its mark in the city and still shapes the identity of parts of the society. Based on past crisis experiences, one should examine how the immigrant identity connects with crisis and disaster management. Even more, one should explore how the current refugee crisis in Greece is perceived by the groups of society having a refugee identity due to the ‘20s crisis taking into account that there are significant profile differences between the Greek refugees of the 20’s and today’s multi-national and multi-cultural refugee influx.
			</p>
			<p>
				iii) In general, city museums foster cultural memory of disasters. Nonetheless, they do not necessarily consider how this memory can become an asset for rising disaster awareness and initiating action for disaster protection. On the other hand civil protection and disaster management entities target disaster protection but as a rule fail to consider historic museums and relating communities as historians, museologists, ethnographers as their peers in disaster management. Bridging this gap can be highly beneficial for making cultural memory an asset of/for disaster risk reduction and disaster management.  
			</p>
			<p>
				iv) The Museum of the City of Volos presents in a contemporary and engaging manner, much information on earthquake and flood disasters which devastated the city in the ‘60s. What is missing though is the link between been aware of the history of disasters and taking action towards earthquake or flood protection. There is a huge challenge in using existing historic information in order to trigger action for disaster protection today. This is especially true as regards social groups which are considered as difficult in DRR such as teenagers. The effort here should focus in using a visit to the City Museum and information on past disasters in order to trigger action towards self-protection and protection at a family and school level. 
			</p>
			<p>
				v) Although there are no memorials per se to commemorate past disasters in Volos, cultural memory of disasters manifests itself in various manners. A tangible outcome of past disasters is the urban tissue and the building stock generated through the recovery efforts following the disasters of the ‘60s. As an outcome of earthquake recovery, there are still building types and structural systems in the city that the population identifies as safe. Studying recovery in its various aspects and the changes it brought to the city exposes cultural memory and provides a basis for more a informed handling of present disaster risk in the city. Of relevance here are both soft and hard infrastructure aspects and how they have marked cultural memory and the city itself.
			</p>
			<h2 id="2.3">The objectives in Volos CS: how can the consideration of culture help to address the existing issues?</h2>
			<p>
				Cultural networks, cultural memory, infrastructure (soft and hard), empathy (mainly as enhanced through policy exercises and serious games), learning are the five basic elements of culture that are taken into account in EDUCEN. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Volos has suffered by major crises and disasters in its past that have been experienced only by a minor portion of the present population this making cultural memory in the centre of Volos case study. It should be noticed though that setting cultural memory as the focus of Volos CS does not mean that the other key concepts of EDUCEN namely cultural networks, infrastructure (soft and hard) and cultural empathy, are not relevant or even significant. Figure 1 presents how Volos CS links with key concepts tackled in EDUCEN and other CSs. 
			</p>
			<h3 id="2.3.1">Objectives of the CS explained to a technical audience/first responders</h3>
			<p>
				Overall, Volos CS aims at defending the case of culture and especially of cultural memory as an asset in DDR and disaster management. Cultural memory is an elusive concept as it refers to disasters and crises that present generations have not experienced. Studying the history of the city and identifying critical events that have marked the memory of the city is methodologically a starting point for examining how cultural memory can become an asset of DRR and disaster management.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Volos CS fosters the dialogue between different disciplines and different roles in the fields of culture and history on the one hand and civil protection, disaster risk reduction and crisis management on the other.  Our objective is to demonstrate that earthquake and flood protection is not solely a matter of engineering and structural measures; understanding and employing tangible and intangible manifestations of memory of past disaster and crises has significant advantages for DRR and crisis management especially at local level. Thus, this CS attempts to recognize, identify and operationalize cultural memory of disasters in Volos (and in Greece) so that it can be utilized for:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Better decision making incorporating knowledge (and wisdom) from past disasters in all phases of a disaster</li>
				<li>More comprehensive urban planning that takes into account disaster risk in its social and cultural dimensions</li>
				<li>More inclusive disaster protection considering social groups such as refugees, immigrants, the elders</li>
				<li>Better crisis and disaster management profiting from what remains in the memory of the society from past disasters; accumulated memories are tools for rising disaster awareness, promoting a culture of prevention, effectively engaging various social groups in handling emergencies, sidestepping past mishandlings of disasters and risks.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="2.3.2">Objectives of the CS explained to the local population/users</h3>
			<p>
				Risk exists in every aspect of life. One has to deal with various risks every day. Within the landscape of risks, the risk of a disaster triggered by an earthquake or a flood often seems less important compare to everyday socioeconomic risks such as crime, poverty, unemployment, homelessness, loss of access to health and welfare services etc. Devastating past disasters indicate that disaster risk is not to be ignored both by the governments at various levels and by individuals, families and the society.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Cultural memory of disasters makes us more aware of disaster risk and shows us the benefits of taking action for our protection in the event of an earthquake, a flood or other hazard today. Volos suffered from disasters in the past and the signs of those rise demands for present action that can save us sometime in the future. There are plenty of guidelines and instructions available indicating simple and less simple disaster protection measures that we individuals and households could take. Simple actions today can save us tomorrow, if only we could see the priority of taking action against disaster risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, past catastrophes show that collective involvement in handling a disaster or crisis pays out. Trust in government action in the event of a disaster is important, but what if it is not adequate? What happens if official response to an emergency fails? Individual and collective action in society towards disaster risk reduction is essential especially in the era of an economic and social crisis. How one can enhance collective disaster protection today? Social networks operate as a safety belt in adversity but how one can use social networking to increase resilience to disaster? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Volos CS attempts to examine how past crises affect the involvement in crisis management and disaster risk reduction today. Our focus is the refugees and the teenagers; regarding those two groups our aim is to enhance disaster risk awareness and to promote taking action for disaster protection.</p>
