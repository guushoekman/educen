# Soft/hard infrastructures: a resilience-based approach for DRR

## Introduction
<div class="col-md-4 content-infobox" style="float:right">
	<a href=""><h4>L’Aquila earthquake (2009)</h4></a>
	<div>L’Aquila city has a long history of disastrous earthquakes (1461, 1703, 1915, 2009). The earthquake in 2009 struck L’Aquila province at 3.32 a.m. on 6 April 2009. As a consequence, 308 people died and 1500 resulted injured. Although the magnitude was moderate, the impacts were high, mainly due to the high urban vulnerability.</div>

Disasters cause serious damage on structures and infrastructures, particularly in urban areas. All the lifelines (‘hard infrastructures’, e.g. water supply, transport, power supply, telecommunication) are impacted by extreme events, and their functionality is limited as a consequence of both physical damages and changes in the operating conditions. Lifelines are vulnerable elements, but also crucial assets to guarantee the safety and well-being of the impacted population. The role of hard infrastructures at urban level supports the efforts of local communities during the EM, being a key asset to cope with the disaster. As a matter of fact, society and local economy benefit from the operation of hard infrastructural systems.

Disasters cause complex short- and long-term effects on social structures as well, which are often difficult to understand and define (soft infrastructures). Community organizations and community-based networks play a key role in disaster preparedness and recovery. Local knowledge, understandings, perceptions, resources, and cooperative strategies are crucial to determine system survival and, particularly, to properly drive recovery conditions. 

A strong connection exists between the two infrastructures: the reliability of physical infrastructures during the emergency management contributes to mobilize the social capital. Similarly, the existing soft infrastructures may condition the performances and the level of service provided by the hard infrastructures. More specifically, infrastructural systems play a fundamental role in keeping alive the social networks within a community in case of disasters by continuing to provide key services. The process of recovery after extreme events, is also generally supported by the availability of critical services, which significantly contribute to increase the resilience of the whole community.

	<div>Lifelines are highly vulnerable elements in emergency condition, but represent a key resource to support a quick and effective recovery. The infrastructural system of a city is linked with social and institutional systems, but also with the economic and environmental ones that are all embedded within the urban context and dynamically interacting.</div>

Resilient systems have a reduced probability of failure, lower consequences from failures and a reduced time for recovery. At urban scale, resilience is related to the capacity of cities to cope with and recover from external shocks. Infrastructural systems of a city are linked with social and institutional systems, but also with the economic and environmental ones, and thus their resilience is necessarily connected to several intertwined dimensions.

Enhancing resilience means improving the capacity of the whole system to anticipate threats, reduce vulnerability and allow a complete recovery from impacts. Several factors contribute to increase the resilience, related to the ‘physical’ and ‘non-physical’ characteristics of the system. All these features are found to be highly influential in all phases of a disaster.
