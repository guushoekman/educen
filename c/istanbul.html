			<h1>Istanbul case study</h1>
			<h2 id="2.1">Prologue</h2>
			<p>
				From June 2015 to November 2017, Turkish Search and Rescue Association AKUT has realized an innovative field action in Istanbul as a part of the European Disasters in Urban Centers (EDUCEN) Project, an international coordination and support action financed by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Program. In accordance with the project’s main theme, which is the (possible) contributions of culture to disaster management and disaster risk reduction, AKUT’s public training unit has decided to work on the disability and disaster issue under the direction of the CS leader. Being aware of the specific problems experienced by people with disabilities during disasters, and also, the lack of access to disaster preparedness information for the disabled, AKUT’s training unit has collaborated with seven partner organizations in order to design a new training model. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not surprisingly, the action has gone beyond a mere adaptation work, pushing the “non-disabled side” to alter its perception of the disability, discover and embrace a modern definition of the phenomenon and recognize the importance of concepts like “diversity” and “inclusivity” as a sound basis for all action in this field. Let’s note that Turkey’s first and largest volunteer search and rescue group has taken important steps in improving its inclusivity and accessibility thanks to the feedback and knowledge gained through EDUCEN case study. While the disability culture has initiated a transformation at AKUT in this regard, the representatives of the disabled community had in their turn the occasion to look at the emergency and disaster-related issues from a new perspective, according to which they could take part in reducing their own vulnerability to disasters, actively assist others in doing so and even take important leadership roles during such incidents. The resulting training model emphasizes the need for addressing mixed audiences through specifically adapted tools, supported by supplementary materials, which are accessible through Internet for all involved groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being based on citizen action and using public training as the main dissemination tool, Istanbul Case Study should be regarded as a cost-effective, replicable model for any similar work with the additional social benefit of including the disabled citizens in the DRR.		
			</p>
			<p>
				The following is an “annotated” account of the EDUCEN Istanbul Case Study, which is also designed to be a “flexible” guideline. It is primarily intended for formal and informal citizen groups (NGOs, citizen initiatives...) who aim to develop and implement their own local action to help disabled community reduce its vulnerability to disasters. Also, the practice derived from Istanbul action is certainly useful for relevant professional groups in the disaster management cycle (planners, managers, responders) who should consider persons with disabilities in all phases of disaster management. Nevertheless, we have to affirm that we did not anticipate any limits in terms of usability for this document: Professionals who belong to medical universe, education professionals and disability professionals would likewise benefit from it.
			</p>
			<h2 id="2.2">The Rationale: Why Working on Disaster and Disability?</h2>
			<p>
				Looking at AKUT’s past, it can hardly be argued that disability had been a priority for Turkey’s largest non-governmental volunteer rescue organization, until recently. Since its foundation in 1996, AKUT has developed -for example- neither a specific operational procedure concerning assistance to people with disabilities during disasters, nor an inclusive membership policy or recruitment effort targeting them. Likewise, the association’s premises, just as its communicative materials remained inaccessible for a large part of the disability spectrum until the issue has been placed recently on the agenda. However, considering this situation as a deliberate omission or discrimination would be an overstatement since members were not insensible to disability neither, as illustrated by sporadic cooperations with disability organizations.1 In fact, what we observe in AKUT’s first twenty years can be seen as the reflection of a broader scale phenomenon in the society, which is the lack of awareness of disability: Not only of the needs but also of the capabilities and knowledge of disabled individuals. It would be probably reasonable to admit that the association’s relationship to disability has followed the existing trends in the society.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another point worth mentioning is that AKUT had -almost- no members having  significant disabilities. The presence of active disabled members could perhaps create awareness about the disability issue over the years and even drive the association towards inclusivity. We can no doubt point to different facts explaining this situation but in our eyes, the most interesting one relate to the characteristics of search and rescue activity. The latter is often considered as an “edgework” that requires a high degree of physical ability and strength, other than specialized knowledge.1 What is seldom affirmed is that those requirements are not relevant to all phases of rescue work as opposite to what is perceived from outside. Not all components of search and rescue operations are performed by people with extreme physical capabilities and technical specialties. In fact, individuals who are far from being competition-level athletes but who are provided with basic knowledge can perform many duties that are vital to operations. Yet the image of rescuer “above the ordinary man” cause reluctance in many people who could join a search and rescue group. During the case study, we have observed that the disabled participants were far from being immune to this exaggerated image of search and rescue volunteers as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is interesting is that while remained “distant” -not to say inaccessible- for people with disabilities for various reasons, AKUT continuously encountered disability in practice, essentially during two cores activities emanating from its official mission. The first of these practice areas was naturally the search and rescue, where some members, including the Istanbul CS leader himself, have observed the additional complexity that disability or chronicle health conditions can bring about in emergency situations, and also observed the need for specific training, equipment and professional support in order to cope with such cases.

			    <h4>Disability in Turkey</h4>
			    <p>
			    	Like any country across the globe, the disabled constitute a significantly large “minority” in Turkey, especially if we take into account individuals with chronic diseases. Although the latest available data (12 % of the general population) is from 2002, we have no reason to consider that this figure has decreased. The global estimated average, in a recent figure given by the World Health Organization, supports this proportion: 15 %. Again, according to the 2002 data, people with auditory, speech and visual impairments, orthopaedic and mental disabilities constitute 2.58 % of the general population in Turkey. Consequently, we can assume that Istanbul is home to a “core” disabled group of about 400,000 individuals considering also the increase in population since the last survey. As for the remaining 9.42 % (roughly 1.3 million people), this group is mainly composed of citizens with chronic health problems. Even though citizens with chronic conditions (if not coupled with a certain form of disability) often experience less limitations in life and possess a greater autonomy, this chronic group should be the subject of specific measures since they usually also have special needs to be addressed during and after a catastrophe. 
			    </p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The second activity where AKUT came into contact with disability has been the disaster awareness and preparedness trainings destined to public. Facing questions by disabled participants or their relatives, the volunteer trainers who reach out tens of thousands citizens every year have increasingly doubted the “universality” of the disaster preparedness content that they disseminated.1 Gradually, they have come to recognize that AKUT’s training material seemed to address “healthy” adults only, excluding the less “fit” groups such as elderly, children, people with chronic health conditions or disabilities. Besides, as they have realized, some of these groups had obstacles in getting sound information on disaster risks and disaster preparedness. Few materials existed for people with visiual or hearing impairments.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can argue that the experience gained in these two areas resulted in growing consciousness in the association’s core (most active) group. A limited but meaningful change in the perception of the disability issue prepared the terrain for a dedicated, systematic action on disaster and disability in AKUT.  Notably, a visit by a group of graduate students from Harvard Business School (HBS) in 2013 has been the first occasion to tackle the question. Upon the proposal by the Istanbul CS Leader -then the research officer of the association- the visiting students carried out a field study and designed an “awareness campaign on earthquake preparedness for disabled citizens” in Istanbul, in order to complete their graduate program.1 The seismic risk was focused on as the most important disaster risk the city was exposed to.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the developed campaign could been never materialized due to financial reasons, it brought a new insight into the issue by providing an accurate technical description of the conditions on the ground for the disabled in Turkey and the barriers which prevent them from accessing disaster preparedness programs. HBS team also proposed a realistic strategy based on practical, measurable goals for AKUT to reach the disabled population. The result was exploitable for all types of major emergencies and catastrophes, not only for the earthquakes. We should note that the many components of the elegant strategy that was elaborated by the HBS team remain useful. Nevertheless, the fact that it was concentrated on “improving the delivery” (how to ensure physical participation of the disabled?) and on the tactics for drawing people with disabilities (what kind of incentives can be used?) to training sessions, was a serious limit for developing a comprehensive action. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Such a view on disability is closely linked to human rights. In fact, the (relatively) recent right-based approach to disability is mostly an emphasis of the fact that persons with disabilities should also enjoy these fundamental rights. We have concluded that the principles of “equality” and “non-discrimination” alone were sufficient to tackle the disability and disaster issue. Since the people with disabilities “should enjoy their inherent right to life on an equal basis with others” and their “physical and mental integrity of persons with disabilities” must be protected, “just as for everyone else”1, they also must enjoy support that is “as good as that enjoyed by the general population during emergencies and disasters”.2 In other words, protection against disaster risks and provision of support after disasters is a non-alienable rigth for the disabled citizens as well.3 Naturally, this right includes the right to information on disaster risks and preparedness, which corresponded well to Istanbul Case Study’s aim. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Consider disability as a part of human diversity and not a personal tragedy, focusing on disabled people’s capacities, and concentrate on how they can contribute to Istanbul Case Study;
				</li>
				<li>
					Ensure the necessary adjustments in the physical environment and if necessary, the social arrangements in order to make the action (and information) accessible to them, which is a prerequisite for inclusion,
				</li>
				<li>
					Include as much as possible the disabled persons in the action so they could take up their role as active, equal citizens; defying prejudices and stereotypes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As we have realized later, we could grasp the meaning of these terms only after we had started to cooperate with our disabled partners, when we encountered disability knowledge and culture. Still, our “theoretical build” has met no opposition on behalf of the disabled partners and remained unchanged throughout the case study, providing us guidance when we were in need of it.
			</p>
			<h2>Networking for partnership</h2>
			<p>
				While building the theoretical argumentation for the case study, we have also worked for developing a strategy and an action plan in order to reach our aim. The initial strategy we had submitted in the project proposal consisted on producing multiple versions of AKUT’s existing public disaster preparation material, each version being adapted for a specific disability group. According to this scheme, disabled partners’ feedback about the present training content would be collected through focus-group meetings, interviews and questionnaires; to be integrated in the content. The same feedback, together with some technical knowledge, would help AKUT to create the adopted versions to be used afterwards. Having gained a better understanding of the disability phenomenon, we had noticed that this crude strategy that gave AKUT the “lead role” in the action needed to be altered to be genuinely inclusive. Nevertheless, it was adequate as a starting point, especially when looking for shareholders but we first had to make a decisive choice about which disability groups to work with.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although our initial idea had been to cooperate with shareholders representing a maximum variety from the disability spectrum, the preliminary study we have conducted and our exchanges with different experts have made us realize that it would be realistic to narrow our focus down as much as possible. Our financial means, human resources being very limited and timespan being very short for addressing almost all types of disability, we have decided to establish some precise limits for the action. But we also knew that the selection had to be carefully justified so it would not have signified “exclusion” for those who were not selected. The most difficult issue was whether we had the potential for addressing persons with mental disabilities.

			    <h4>Building a Cooperative Network</h4>
			    <p>
			    	Our experience in general with respect to partnership building is that flexibility is the key for organizing a cooperative action, which becomes possible only to the extent that the action’s goals meet potential partners’ agendas. Genuine cooperation is based on an egalitarian relationship and not on a top-down approach. This naturally involves a certain level of bargain between two organizations with different aims, capabilities and needs and flexibility is necessary to reconcile mutual demands, including the design of the activities and the calendar.
			    </p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<p>
				After much discussion, we have decided to consider people with mental disabilities in a next stage, for the following reasons: Our interviews with medical professionals and caretakers have showed us that we would be able to address only a very limited portion of the existing mental disability groups with significant efficiency. Our conclusion was that it would be more realistic to focus on these groups, in parallel with the families and care professionals they were depending on, in a dedicated project that would be realized in cooperation with a network of specialists, for AKUT having absolutely not the knowledge and expertise on working with having mental disabilities. The decision was indeed a difficult one to make, and the technical argument was not the only one that has influenced it. In fact, we have also faced a powerful ethical dilemma during this stage, which was the question of informed consent. To obtain the participants’ consent about the activity of which they are going to be a part is an absolute ethical and legal condition, also a requirement by the European Commission, but a valid consent can only be given by a person who has legal autonomy, a delicate issue when it comes to persons with cognitive impairments. Our consultation with a legal specialist further justified our reticence on this issue, helping us understand this autonomy/consent issue alone would require dedicated preparation (which may ensure a legal basis, but would not guarantee an ethical solution) which would be beyond the Istanbul Case Study’s limited means. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the people with physical disabilities, we have decided to consider the groups, which could potentially endure the biggest hardships during and after a disaster: Persons with impaired sight, persons with hearing impairments and people with reduced mobility. Note that we also excluded the minors from the case study, as their participation was -both legally and ethically- subject to specific rules and conditions, such as the parental consent. That was in fact a further point in defining the scope of the action, which we now considered as a “pilot” work that was supposed to demonstrate the feasibility and the potential of the “Istanbul model” to be built. The model would then set an example for larger and technically more sophisticated projects, such as one destined to people with mental disabilities. 
			</p>
			<h2 id="2.3">Ethics of Cooperation</h2>
			<p>
				Even for a field action with a limited research component, submission to ethics reviewing requires a careful preparation. The submission document has to answer in detail quiet a few questions about the aim and the rationale of the action, its expected outcomes and possible contributions to our existing knowledge, the selection, recruitment and inclusion of the participants, the measures to be taken in order to protect them from harm, their intended role in the action, the methods to be used for data collection and preservation, as well as for ensuring privacy and confidentiality… In fact, these questions seek to understand if the following principles have been taken into account in the design of the action:
			</p>
			<div class="col-sm-4 pull-right" style="padding-right: 0">
				<img src="../img/istanbul1.jpg" style="width: 100%">
			</div>
			<p>
				It is important to note that submission for ethics review should take place before the recruitment of the participants or data collection (except for preliminary activities). Clearly, the participants’ consent should also be obtained before the action starts. In the EDUCEN Istanbul Case Study, we did not have any issues with documenting it despite the fact that we worked with participants with impaired sight and with hearing impairments, for whom documents with Latin script could be partially or totally inaccessible. Let us underline that people with the mentioned disabilities have legally right to sign any documents by themselves in Turkey. Yet, as the main issue here is to obtain informed consent, and not only ensure legal compliance, we sent the consent form long to our shareholder associations long before the focus-group meetings, giving them time to have it read (and translated if necessary) by persons of trust in case they prefer to do so. Again, the consent form was read aloud before the start of the focus-group meetings (simultaneously translated by a certified translator in the case of people with total hearing loss), before signature by the participants.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had obtained the participants contact information prior to meetings (usually about a week before) in order to get prepared in terms of support. Four to six volunteers from AKUT’s “public training unit” have been present during the meetings that have been held at AKUT’s premises. Their contribution has proved extremely valuable not only from the conceptual side of the work but also from logistics perspective for they have taken care, for example, of participants arrival to AKUT building from the subway station and ensured their safe return the same way. 
			</p>
			<p>
					The “logistics” of the meetings itself takes much more time and effort than expected and should be carefully planned before, including the catering. The number of participants being around 11 for each meeting (min.8-max.13), we tried to include at least 2 AKUT supports staff for every 4 participant. We have had one support staff for every 3 participants in the case of people with visual disabilities who may need more guidance in a physical space they are familiar with. Thus the case study leader and the trainer (head of the public training unit as the most experienced trainer) could focus on their tasks: The first one has focused on taking minutes and moderating the discussions, while the second delivered the training. Also both have observed the progress of the meeting for a later evaluation and exchange.
