						<p>
							On April 6, 2009, an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude struck central Italy with its epicentre near L'Aquila. The earthquake caused damage to between 3,000 and 10,000 buildings in the ciy and several buildings collapsed. 308 people were killed by the earthquake, and approximately 1,500 people were injured. Around 65,000 people were made homeless.

						L’Aquila city had experienced multiple relevant earthquakes in the past. A disastrous earthquake occurred in 1461, with an estimated magnitude of 6.5 and approximately 150 victims. Another relevant earthquake occurred in 1703 (it was a part of a significant earthquake sequence), and killed approximately 6000 people in the city and its surroundings. Referring to the recent history, an event in January 1915 killed 32500 people, including almost the whole population of Avezzano, 50 km south of L’Aquila.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Case Study refers to the disastrous 6.3 earthquake which struck L’Aquila city and its province at 3.32 a.m. on 6 April 2009. As a consequence of the event, 308 people died and 1500 resulted injured. <a class="btn-u btn-u-dark btn-brd btn-read-more btn-u-xs" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#read-more-1">Read more</a>

						Although the physical event was relatively moderate (moment magnitude 6.3), its impacts were particularly high, mainly due to the very high vulnerability of lives, livelihoods, building stock and institutions in the Apennine Mountains. The event got a great interest worldwide also due to a series of scandals and controversies that are still ongoing. Just to provide a well-known example, one of the most controversial issues related to the earthquake was the trial and prosecution of seven functionaries of the Italian National Department of Civil Protection (DPC), mainly due to the kind information (“incomplete, imprecise and contradictory on the nature, causes, dangers and future development of seismic activity in the area in question” - Il Centro 2012) shared with the community. It resulted that some citizens had acted on that information and as a consequence had lost their lives.

						The aim of this manual is to collect, structure and enable the transferability of the experiences carried out in the L’Aquila Case Study during the implementation of the EDUCEN project. In order to enhance the readability of the manual, the performed activities have been clustered in two main groups:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The cluster for the analysis of the network of interaction among different emergency responders, which aimed at mapping and analysing the complex network of interactions taking place in case of emergency. To this aim, storyline approach, cognitive mapping and social network analysis methods were sequentially implemented.
						</li>
						<li>
							The cluster for the analysis of soft and hard infrastructure resilience, which aimed at better comprehend how soft and hard infrastructures interact in order to make the whole urban system more resilient in case of disaster. To this aim, system dynamic modelling and graph theory were adopted.  
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							Both activities were developed and calibrated referring to the retrospective analysis of the earthquake in 2009.

					<p>
						The activities concerning culture and DRR carried out in L’Aquila allows to provide hints to emergency managers aiming at enhancing their capability to comprehend and account for the differences in problem perception and organizational and cultural differences when developing and implementing the emergency management plans. Specifically, the lessons learned from L’Aquila experiences could support emergency managers in overcoming the main barriers hampering the flow of information among institutional and non-institutional actors, and to enhance the cooperative emergency management process.
					</p>
					<p>
						This Manual documents the activities undertaken with aim of producing the aforementioned improvements. The scope of this manual is twofold. On the one hand, it illustrates the main results obtained during the implementation of the EDUCEN activities. This part of the manual aims at enabling the scientific transferability in other CS of the methods and tools adopted in L’Aquila. The main audience of this part of the manual is the technical and scientific community involved in supporting the management of the different phases of the DRR. On the other hand, the manual aims at collecting and structuring the experiences and lessons learned from the main actors, both institutional and non-institutional, enabling the process of mutual learning, which is the main scope of the EDUCEN projects.

					<h3>Key phases</h3>

								<h2>Knowledge elicitation</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-md-12">
										<p>
											Modeling activities required a careful integration of the scientific knowledge available in literature with expert knowledge, which was elicited through semi-structured interviews, according to participatory work principles. Literature evidences were used to develop the first version of the conceptual model identifying the main cause-effect relationships. The domain experts, both institutional actors and citizens directly involved in emergency activities, cooperated in the knowledge elicitation and preliminary modelling phases.

								<h2>Conceptual modeling</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-md-12">
										<p>
											The experts involved in modeling activities (institutional actors, researchers and citizens) were clustered in two different groups in order to support on one hand the phase of conceptual model building and on the other the definition of the stock and flow model, with its consequential calibration and validation. 
										</p>
										<p>
											The process of group model building started from the conceptual model definition, representing the sum of cause-effect chains influencing the stock and flow model. In order to gather the fundamental individual and collective knowledge, the domain experts integrated the conceptual model, adding or deleting variables and modifying links. The modelling process ended when no new concepts and/or relationships emerged after a number of interviews and researchers supported the global model design. The interviews were carried out limiting bias in expert knowledge collection: particular attention was made on problem framing (to reduce subjectivity and ambiguity), availability issues (the tendency to overestimate the magnitude of recent/familiar events) and anchoring (systematic underestimation of uncertainty/variability).
										</p>
										<p>
											Specifically, the experts were asked to describe the main variables and to properly connect them according to the expected influences. They were also asked to provide a quantitative interpretation of all the considered variables (even non-physical ones, such as knowledge level) and of their potential states. Finally, they were asked to describe the dynamic evolution of the variables, the main causes of these changes and the potential effects.
										</p>

							</div>
						</li>
						<li class="equal-height-columns">

							<div class="cbp_tmlabel equal-height-column">
								<h2>SDM model building</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-md-12">
										<p>
											The conceptual model was then used as a basis for the development of the stock-and-flow model. A first subset of variables was defined referring to the conceptual model, i.e. level of knowledge, available economic resources, water demand (from both population on site and population in shelter camps), level of service/loss of service. Such variables were modeled as stocks, according to the SDM methodology, since they describe the accumulation or depletion of both physical and non-physical resources. Another subset of variables was defined and modeled as ‘conveyors’ using the collected knowledge. Those variables are related to either externally specified conditions (e.g. ‘intensity of the hazard’), or to actions/policies that can be implemented and may have an influence on resilience levels (e.g. increasing the training level of employees, implement monitoring activities, availability of GIS and database).
										</p>
										<p>
											The general structure of the model was then discussed with a sub-group of experts, who reviewed the variables and their relationships. Additionally, a quantitative calibration was performed referring to L’Aquila earthquake case study. A few key stocks were selected for calibration (e.g. ‘water deficit’), and their dynamic evolution was simulated. Experts were asked to identify for each variable a scatter plot to build an expected trend. The comparison between the expected and the predicted trend allowed the calibration of the key equations used in the model. Small deviations were attributed to the difficulties in collecting reliable data. Nevertheless, the experts considered these deviations as minor.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The topology of critical infrastructures, such as water distribution systems, can be easily described through the definition of a network of nodes connected by links. The structure of the network itself reflects the characteristics of the underlying network of users of the service, both in terms of spatial pattern and in terms of service requirements and expected performances (e.g. the nodes reflect the water demand). The topology and the functionality are thus two strictly intertwined aspects of the operation of the whole system. It is worth to consider that this underlying pattern of users, and their specific needs, evolves with time during the whole emergency, and thus the network should be flexible enough to provide a sufficient level of service, although somehow limited, even in case of dramatic changes in some conditions (e.g. extensive damages in the network).
