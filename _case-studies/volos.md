</div>
Volos is a coastal city situated midway on the Greek mainland (Figure …). The urban area counts for 150,009 inhabitants (as in 2015) and covers 496.6 km2. It is a port city and the only outlet to the sea of Thessaly which is the country's largest agricultural region. The city has been a significant industrial centre which gradually declined mainly due to deindustrialization after the mid- 80s. The current economic crisis has deteriorated the situation. Presently, the city experiences very high unemployment rates.


Volos has experienced several critical events, among them a massive influx of Greek refugees in the years 1922-26, WWII followed by the civil war, earthquake and flood disasters in the period 1954-57.

In the early ‘20s, huge numbers of Greek refugees from Turkey fled to Greece. The unsuccessful Campaign of Greece in Asia Minor in 1922 and the exchange of populations that followed resulted at about 1,500,000 Greek refugees moving towards Greece. A number of 13,773 of them came to Volos due to the easy access to the port and work perspectives in the commercial and industrial sectors. This number corresponds to more than 40% of the population of the city at the time. Ultimately many of the refugees settled in the outskirts of the city where the settlement of Nea Ionia (“Nea” means “New” and “Ionia” is the name of an ancient Greek city on the coast of Asia Minor) was formed. Although there was a need for workers, especially in the industry, the integration of this new coming Greek population was not smooth.


Nea Ionia became a Municipality (Figure 1) and remained so untill 2011 when, due to a restructuring programme of local and regional administration, it was merged with other Municipalities to what Volos Municipality is today (Figure 2).

## Rationale of Volos CS: issues to be tackled

Volos has suffered major crises and disasters in its past. These have been experienced by only few of present population, this making cultural memory a key issue of Volos case study. Cultural memory of disasters becomes especially important in the era of the current economic and social crisis in Greece which alters the risk perception and the hierarchy of risks. Perception of present socioeconomic risks (such as unemployment, poverty, loss of access to the health and welfare system, homelessness, crime, foreign refugees influx to name only a few) seems to prevail in the risk landscape while disaster risk falls in the hierarchy of risks perceived by the society. Therefore It becomes crucial to employ memory of past disasters in order to advance DRR and disaster management.

>It is crucial to employ memory of past disasters in order to advance DRR and disaster management. 

An analysis of former catastrophes in Volos and in Greece brings up a number of issues and lessons learned that call for an enhanced use of cultural dimensions, among them cultural memory, in and for disaster management. Some of these are: 

1. Immigrants and foreigner tourists are identified as difficult groups to deal with in crisis and disaster management. The severe immigrant crisis in the ’20s in Volos left its mark in the city and still shapes the identity of parts of the society. Based on past crisis experiences, one should examine how the immigrant identity connects with crisis and disaster management. Even more, one should explore how the current refugee crisis in Greece and Europe is perceived by the groups of society originating from refugees of the ‘20s;  even so one must take into account that there are significant differences in the profile of the Greek refugees of the 20’s and today’s multi-national and multi-cultural refugee influx.
2. In general, city museums foster cultural memory of disasters. Nonetheless, they do not necessarily consider how this memory can become an asset for rising disaster awareness and initiating action for disaster protection. On the other hand civil protection and disaster management entities target disaster protection but as a rule fail to consider historic museums and relating communities as historians, museologists, ethnographers as their peers in disaster management. Bridging this gap can be highly beneficial for making cultural memory an asset of/for disaster risk reduction and disaster management.  
3. The Museum of the City of Volos presents in a contemporary and engaging manner, earthquake and flood disasters which devastated the city in the ‘50s. What is missing though is the link between been aware of the history of disasters and taking action towards earthquake or flood protection. There is a huge challenge in using existing historic information in order to trigger action for disaster protection today. This is especially true as regards social groups which are considered difficult in DRR such as teenagers. The effort here should focus in using a visit to the City Museum and information on past disasters in order to trigger action towards self-protection and protection at a family and school level. 
4. Although there are no memorials per se to commemorate past disasters in Volos, cultural memory of disasters manifests itself in various manners. A tangible outcome of past disasters is the urban tissue and the building stock generated through the recovery efforts following the disasters of the ‘60s. As an outcome of earthquake recovery, there are still building types and structural systems in the city that the population identifies as safe. Studying recovery in its various aspects and the changes it brought to the city exposes cultural memory and provides a basis for more informed handling of present disaster risk in the city. Of relevance here are both soft and hard infrastructure aspects and how they have marked the city and connect to cultural memory.


## The objectives in Volos CS: how can the consideration of culture help to address the existing issues?
Cultural networks, cultural memory, infrastructure (soft and hard), empathy (mainly as enhanced through policy exercises and serious games), learning are the five core elements of culture that are examined in EDUCEN. Cultural memory in the centre of Volos case study and rightly so as Volos has suffered major crises and disasters in its past that have been experienced only by a minor portion of the present population. 
It should be noticed that setting cultural memory as the focus of Volos CS does not mean that the other key concepts of EDUCEN namely cultural networks, infrastructure (soft and hard) and cultural empathy, are not relevant or even significant. Figure 1 presents how Volos CS links with other CSs key concepts and key elements of culture examined in EDUCEN.

{% include image.html img="volos3.png" title="title for image" caption="Figure 5. Links and interfaces between EDUCEN Case Studies and key concepts" %}

Although the key concepts are not isolated and there are interfaces and links between them, for methodological reasons they are presented separately in the following.

### Objectives of the CS explained to a technical audience/first responders
Overall, Volos CS aims at defending the case of culture and especially of cultural memory as an asset in DDR and disaster management. Cultural memory is an elusive concept as it refers to disasters and crises that present generations have not experienced. Studying the history of the city and identifying critical events that have marked the memory of the city is methodologically a starting point for examining how cultural memory can become an asset of DRR and disaster management.

Volos CS fosters the dialogue between different disciplines and different roles in the fields of culture and history on the one hand and civil protection, disaster risk reduction and crisis management on the other.  Our objective is to demonstrate that earthquake and flood protection is not solely a matter of engineering and structural measures; understanding and employing tangible and intangible manifestations of memory of past disaster and crises has significant advantages for DRR and crisis management, especially at local level. Thus, this CS attempts to recognize, identify and operationalise cultural memory of disasters in Volos (and in Greece) so that it can be utilized for:

- Better decision making incorporating knowledge (and wisdom) from past disasters in all phases of a disaster
- More comprehensive urban planning that takes into account disaster risk in its social and cultural dimensions
- More inclusive disaster protection considering social groups such as refugees, immigrants, elders
- Better crisis and disaster management profiting from what remains in the memory of the society from past disasters; accumulated memories are tools for rising disaster awareness, promoting a culture of prevention, effectively engaging various social groups in handling emergencies, sidestepping past mishandlings of disasters and risks.

### Objectives of the CS targeting the local population/users
Risk exists in every aspect of life; one has to deal with a range of risks every day. Within the landscape of risks, the risk of a disaster triggered by an earthquake or a flood often seems less important compare to everyday socioeconomic risks such as crime, poverty, unemployment, homelessness, loss of access to health and welfare services etc. Devastating past disasters indicate that disaster risk is not to be ignored both by the governments at various levels and by individuals, families and the society as a whole. <a class="btn-u btn-u-dark btn-brd btn-read-more btn-u-xs" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#read-more-1">Read more</a>

<p id="read-more-1" class="collapse">Cultural memory of disasters makes us more aware of disaster risk and shows the benefits of taking action for our protection in the event of an earthquake, a flood or other hazard today. Volos suffered from disasters in the past and the signs of those rise demands for present action that can save us sometime in the future. There are plenty of guidelines and instructions available indicating easy and less easy disaster protection measures that we individuals and households could take. Simple actions today can save us tomorrow, if only we could see the priority of taking action against disaster risk.</p>

In addition, past catastrophes show that collective involvement in handling a disaster or crisis pays out. Trust in government action in the event of a disaster is important, but what if government intervention is not adequate? What happens if official response to an emergency fails? Individual and collective action in society towards disaster risk reduction is essential especially in the era of an economic and social crisis. How one can enhance collective disaster protection today? Social networks operate as a safety belt in adversity, but how one can use social networking to increase resilience to disaster?

These are issues that Volos CS attempts to tackle, focussing on how past crises affect the involvement in crisis management and disaster risk reduction today. Our main target groups are refugees and teenagers; regarding those groups our aim is to enhance disaster risk awareness and to promote taking action for disaster protection.

# Selection of methods: operationalising culture as an asset
Given the spectrum of issues that have been identified as relevant in Volos CS and the range of objectives set, a number of methods were used with the aim to identify elements of cultural memory useful in DRR and how these can become operational.

It should be noted that the first key step towards selecting methods was to grasp main concepts relating culture with disaster and cities. Valuable tools in this have been the “Report on the State of the Art on Culture, DRR and Cities” (Deliverable D1.6) and [EDUCEN wiki](http://www.educenproject.eu/wiki).

Guidance on methods and tools of qualitative research methods were provided by our partner NLDA (for example: International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (2007), “VCA toolbox with reference sheets” accessible at: www.ifrc.org) or found in the literature. Furthermore, significant for the selection of methods was the Document titled “Guiding questions: Operationalization of the State of the Art - Defining, identifying, and mapping key aspects of culture as asset and obstacle to effective urban disaster management” that was developed by NLDA within the EDUCEN project. 

## Exploring the role of cultural networks through Social Network Analysis as an asset in DRR
Social networks are present in all disaster and crisis situation, however their formation and impact varies widely. Volos CS examines the role of social networks only marginally to its prime focus; nonetheless important findings on the role of cultural networks in DRR stemmed during CS activities.

## Cultural memory
Cultural memory is the focus of Volos CS. To implement objectives (i)-(iv), a number of methods are used to pinpoint how cultural memory can become an asset to DRR.

More specifically:
Having in mind objective (i)
- Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in the field of civil protection and local decision making. 
- A round table discussion was organized with Greek civil protection experts and practitioners of different disciplinary backgrounds and having experience from different levels of administration. The guide of the interview is presented in Annex 1. It focused on how cultural memory of past disasters is handled within DRR and crisis management in EDUCEN CS cities. The event was attended by a broad Greek audience among them civil protection and DRR experts.

Having in mind objective (ii)
- Field visits were made to formal and informal camps of newly come to Greece refugees and immigrants, namely in the informal camp in Piraeus Port, in the formal camp in Eleonas and in formal camp Mozas in Volos. During these visits, there were informal discussions with members of involved NGOs, assigned personnel from the administration and refugees-immigrants.                         

In addition, field visits were made to Nea Ionia which is the area of the city of Volos where Greek refugees of the ‘20s have been settled; spontaneous discussions with local people were conducted. 

- A focus group discussion was organised with representatives of refugee associations which are still active in Volos. The guiding questions of the discussion and a brief profile of the participants are presented in Annex 2. What is interesting, although expected, is that the discussion offered input also as regards other EDUCEN key concepts such as cultural networks and soft infrastructure.

<p id="read-more-2" class="collapse">Past disasters and crises which affected Volos is the theme of the exhibition in the Museum of the City of Volos. Moreover, Volos Documentation Centre (VDC) documents past disasters and crisis through old photographs, newspapers, books etc. VDC has organized in 2005 the Conference “Cities in the Mediterranean after earthquakes”. The book of proceedings offers much information on non-technical aspects of disaster reconstruction, among them on the significant role the social, economic and cultural context plays in reconstruction. EDUCEN attempted to bring together previously segregated communities and players; on the one hand the contemporary and very active Museum of the City of Volos and on the other the disaster and civil protection communities of practice. As an outcome, a better understanding of the ground they have in common as regards DRR and better ways to work together was identified.

Having in mind objective IV: 
To pass from knowing the history of the city and past disasters to DRR, EDUCEN brought together the Museum with earthquake protection experts. They both acknowledged that the primary goal of the Museum is not DRR, but they identified potential for jointly develop tools to link history of local past disasters with earthquake protection. Teenagers were recognized as a challenging group and it was decided to find ways to make a visit of teenagers to the Museum of the City of Volos a tool to trigger further action towards earthquake protection at an individual, family and school level,  led to the development of a serious game. The game links the visit to the Museum and its exhibits with measures to be taken for self-protection. Personal stories and life stories and other documents from past disasters were used to enhance empathy of teenagers based on experience of past disasters mediated by a visit to the current exhibition. 

Having in mind objective V:
- Although cultural aspects are more obviously manifested in the response phase of a disaster, both literature and practice indicate strong cultural dimensions in recovery and reconstruction. To explore these, a Workshop was organized with the aim to trigger discussion on soft (non-engineering) aspects of earthquake reconstruction based on past disasters in Greece. The cases of Volos recovery from the disasters of the ‘50s, the reconstruction of Kefalonia island after the devastating earthquake disaster of 1953, the successful reconstruction of Kalamata after the earthquakes of 1986, the changes in urban tissue and street network after the Great Fire of Thessaloniki in 1917, offered the canvas for fruitful discussions among scholars, practitioners and the general public.

## Policy exercises and serious games
A serious game for teenagers is developed linked with the Museum of the City of Volos. The aim is to raise disaster awareness of teenagers who have visited the Museum and to motivate them towards taking disaster protection measures. The game is developing with the collaboration of the Museum of the City of Volos.

## Interaction between soft and hard infrastructure
Disaster recovery of different cities reveals how soft and hard infrastructure link with one another and shape together the future city. 
Recovery and reconstruction of cities leaves signs of cultural memory, both tangible such as the urban tissue, the road network, the buildings stock, and intangible such as social segregation or converge, a dominant mentality such as high reliance in engineering or in the army, trust to institutions or resilience of individuals.

To examine these processes a Workshop was organized with the aim to bring together various fields and disciplines to discuss the recovery and reconstruction of Greek cities that have suffered disasters in the past. The Workshop targeted mainly but not exclusively the technical audience (engineers, urban planners, historians, teachers and also civil protection experts). A series of presentations and discussions brought up various elements linking disaster recovery with soft and hard infrastructure and also, with cultural memory.
